# E-cafe Management System


## Project Description
The E-Cafe Management System is a web-based platform that serves as a solution for college students who face challenges in finding healthy and affordable food options on campus. This system is designed to provide a simple and user-friendly interface for students to order food and drinks online, make reservations, and view menus. It is built using popular web technologies like PHP, JS, and CSS and is hosted on the XAMPP server, which ensures reliability, security, and speed.
The E-Cafe Management System offers a range of functionalities, including the ability to customize meal plans, view nutritional information, and make online payments. The system also provides a back-end interface for cafe owners and staff, enabling them to manage orders, track inventory, and generate reports. By providing a centralized platform for food ordering and delivery, the system streamlines cafe operations and reduces waiting times, providing a more efficient and seamless dining experience for students.
The project's primary aim is to provide an efficient and affordable food ordering system for college students pursuing engineering and medical degrees. The system promotes healthy eating habits and ensures that students have easy access to healthy and affordable food options, which can have a positive impact on academic performance. The system also enables students to provide feedback on their dining experiences, which can be used to improve food quality, service, and overall customer satisfaction.
